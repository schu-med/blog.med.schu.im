>
> EHR-based sepsis research often uses heterogeneous definitions of sepsis
> leading to poor generalizability and difficulty in comparing studies to each
> other. We have developed OpenSep, an open-source pipeline for sepsis
> phenotyping according to the Sepsis-3 definition, as well as determination of
> time of sepsis onset and SOFA scores. The Minimal Sepsis Data Model was
> developed alongside the pipeline to enable the execution of the pipeline to
> diverse sources of electronic health record data. The pipeline's accuracy was
> validated by applying it to the MIMIC-IV version 1.0 data and comparing
> sepsis onset and SOFA scores to those produced by the pipeline developed by
> the curators of MIMIC. We demonstrated high reliability between both the
> sepsis onsets and SOFA scores, however the use of the Minimal Sepsis Data
> model developed for this work allows our pipeline to be applied to more
> broadly to data sources beyond MIMIC.
